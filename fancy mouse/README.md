The idea is to make a fancy trail following your cursor.

To produce what I actually want to make do the following:
take a game of life with special rules, namely B3/S12345 (Maze)
(a cell with 3 neighbors comes to life, a cell with 1 <= n < 6 neighbors stays)
If you now imagine that your mouse has a circle around it that erases the GOL
cells and observe how maze closes behind the cursor as it moves you will get
a lovely pattern.
