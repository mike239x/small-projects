A stable release of graph entangler, kind of. This uses a fixed graph
generator, but can be used for any graphs (those with less edges will work better).
To add next vertex press any button.
This has a weird explosion at the start as you add 6th vertex, and also at the
very start all vertices collapse together even though this probably shouldn't happen.
