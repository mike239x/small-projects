This code should in theory go through all my folders and try to change
icon of each file from 'folder.svg' to 'folder-randomcolor.svg'.
This is supposed to work only for linux!
P.S. as of yet I copied some code from the internet which does something with
files and icons, need to read what exactly it does.
